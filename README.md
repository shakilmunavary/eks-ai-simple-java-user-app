# 🚀 EKS AI Dashboard – Intelligent RCA for Kubernetes Applications

The **EKS AI Dashboard** is a dynamic, agentic RCA solution that combines Kubernetes observability, semantic code retrieval, and LLM-powered diagnostics to surface the root cause of application failures — instantly and intelligently.

This solution is designed to show for how AI can transform DevOps and SRE workflows, reduce MTTR, and empower developers and stakeholders with actionable insights.

---

## 🧠 Solution Summary

Traditional RCA workflows are reactive, noisy, and slow. This dashboard flips the paradigm:

- Extracts pod logs in real time from your EKS cluster
- Uses semantic search to retrieve only the most relevant source code
- Generates RCA using Azure OpenAI with file-level precision
- Presents everything in a clean, Bootstrap-powered dashboard

Whether you're pitching AI in DevOps, onboarding new engineers, or resolving production incidents, this solution delivers clarity, speed, and impact.

## 🔄 Pipeline Flow

1. **Log Extraction**  
   Kubernetes Python client pulls recent pod logs from your EKS cluster.

2. **Semantic Retrieval**  
   FAISS vector DB matches error context to relevant code chunks across your repo.

3. **LLM Analysis**  
   LangChain + Azure OpenAI generate RCA with file locations and fix recommendations.

4. **Dashboard Rendering**  
   Flask app displays everything in a clean Bootstrap UI — ready for developers and stakeholders.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/eks-ai-dashboard
cd eks-ai-dashboard
```

### 2. Configure Environment
Create a `.env` file with:
```env
NAMESPACE=eks-ai
APP_NAME=Demo_EKS_Application
KUBECONFIG_PATH=/path/to/your/kubeconfig
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_GPT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4
AZURE_GPT_API_VERSION=2023-07-01-preview
REPO_ROOT=./eks-ai-simple-java-user-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the Dashboard
```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5004/fd_eks/`

## 🧪 Sample Output

### ✅ Application Info
- Name: `Demo_EKS_Application`
- Namespace: `eks-ai`

### ✅ Pod Details
| Name | Status | Restarts |
|------|--------|----------|
| eks-ai-67f47c676f-l2hxh | Running | 0 |

### ❌ Recent Errors
```plaintext
DispatcherServlet : "ERROR" dispatch for GET "/error"
DispatcherServlet : Exiting from "ERROR" dispatch, status 404
```

### 📁 Source Files Referenced
- `UserController.java`
- `DemoApplication.java`
- `application.properties`

### 🧠 Root Cause Analysis
> The error is configuration-related. The H2 database schema for the `users` table is missing, causing Spring Boot to fail on `/list`. Fix by adding `schema.sql` and initializing the table.
